# CMU 11-785 Deep Learning Spring 2020 (Bhiksha Raj)

This iteration of the course does not contain publically available/open-access videocasts of the lectures, and is therefore not suitable for self-study*. For those interested in self-studying this course, and who are not CMU students, please instead use the material contained at:

https://github.com/cyber-rhythms/cmu-11-785-deep-learning-spring-2019

That is also because the content of the lectures from Spring 2019 and Spring 2020 do not vary much - the lecture slides from Spring 2020 are essentially the same as that of Spring 2019, with some occasional very minor differences. On audit, these differences are minor enough to merit use of Spring 2019 materials instead.

This repo should instead be used as a supplement to the Spring 2019 version - it contains a full, complete set of recitation lecture videocasts, and materials. The homework assignments for this iteration were used in the Spring 2019 repo, as homework assignment content did not change between years, and the latter course page contained broken links for homework assignments. There are some additional supplementary paper recommended readings.  

The course page for this iteration can be found here:

https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/

The main lecture videos are only available for viewing by CMU students.

All the recitation videos are publically available, and can be found here:

By folder the repo contains:

1) cmu-11-785-deep-learning-spring-2020-coursepage - an archived complete html document that that contains the course schedule, in case the link is no longer hosted by CMU,

2) cmu-11-785-deep-learning-spring-2020-coursepage_files folder - relevant files to display the html document.

3) homework-assignments - contains 5 homework assignments.

4) lecture-slides - contains all PDF lecture slides.

5) recitations - contains all PDF recitation lecture slides, data, python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, that accompany the complete list of recitation lectures on Youtube.

Remarks:

Pending -  Need to go through and verify that all the materials for the recitation are fully in order.
